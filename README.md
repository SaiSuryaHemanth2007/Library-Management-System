# 📚 Library Management System in C

A real-time, console-based Library Management System developed using C and fundamental Data Structures. This project allows for efficient management of book records, issuing and returning functionality, and user interaction—all through a structured and modular approach.

 🚀 Features

- Add, remove, and update book records  
- Search books by title or ID  
- Issue and return books  
- Track available and issued books  
- Display all books and their statuses  
- Simple command-line interface  
- Built using **Linked Lists**, **Queues**, and **Stacks**

🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code  
- **Compiler**: GCC  
- **Data Structures**: Linked List, Queue, Stack  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub


📁 Project Structure

📦Library-Management-System ┣ 📄 main.c ┣ 📄 book_operations.c ┣ 📄 user_interface.c ┣ 📄 data_structures.c ┣ 📄 library.h ┗ 📄 README.md

Each module is cleanly separated for readability and scalability.

🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Practical application of core data structures in C  
- Modular programming and file separation  
- Command-line user interface logic  
- Real-time data handling in memory (optional file handling support)

🖥️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git
   cd Library-Management-System

2. Compile the code:

gcc main.c -o library


3. Run the executable:

./library



> ✅ Make sure gcc is installed on your system.



📌 Future Enhancements

Add file handling for data persistence

Admin/User login system

GUI using C++ or Python (e.g., with Tkinter or Qt)

Integration with databases (e.g., MySQL)
